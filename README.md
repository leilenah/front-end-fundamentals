# front-end-fundamentals

This repository contains fundamental information on the three core front end technologies: JavaScript, HTML & CSS. Use this repository to study for your upcoming front end engineer interview ;)

Grunt `grunt-contrib-sass` is used to compile Sass into CSS. This library depends on both [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install), so make sure you have those install before getting started.

```
npm install
