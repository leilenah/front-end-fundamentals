# front-end-fundamentals

This repository organizes front end fundamental information into two sections:
* Core Front End Languages -- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* General Front End Topics

Use this repository to study for your upcoming front end engineer interview!

Grunt `grunt-contrib-sass` is used to compile Sass into CSS. Note that this library depends on both [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install).

Check Ruby & Sass:
```
ruby --version
sass --version
```

Install `npm packages`:
```
npm install
```

Compile Sass changes:
```
grunt sass
```
