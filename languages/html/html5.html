        UPDATES:
            - Semantic (meangful) markup is encouraged

            - Design and content are separated
                - Non-meangful markup is discouraged, e.g.
                    - declaring fonts and text colors
                    - setting text alignment or justification
                    - placing borders on tables
                    - defining how text wraps around an image
                - Style declarations should belong in stylesheets (separation of concerns)
                    - Let content be adapted to context

            - Accessibility is promoted
                - Hard-coding styles into HTML hinders accessibility
                - Not every user can see the styles, which makes that markup irrelevant to them

            - Responsivness is promoted

            - Reduction between overlap in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

            - Rich media is supported (removing the need for Flash or Java)
                - HTML was originally created for hypertext documents with minimal media
                - Flash and Java
                    - External plugins that people had to install on their browser
                    - These plugins performed poorly
